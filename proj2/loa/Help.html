<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
The two players take turns, each moving a piece, and possibly capturing an
opposing piece. The goal of the game is to get all of oneâ€™s pieces into one
group of pieces that are connected. Two pieces are connected if they are
adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Play alternates between Black
and White, with Black moving first. Each move consists of moving a piece of your
color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally onto an empty square or onto a
square occupied by an opposing piece, which is then removed from the board. A
piece may jump over friendly pieces (without disturbing them), but may not cross
enemy pieces, except one that it captures. A piece must move a number of squares
that is exactly equal to the total number of pieces (black and white) on the
line along which it chooses to move (the line of action). This line contains
both the squares behind and in front of the piece that moves, as well as the
square the piece is on. A piece may not move off the board, onto another piece of
its color, or over an opposing piece.
